   - Configured models for users, resources, and onboarding states  

3. **Database Design**  
   - Started with SQLite for simplicity  
   - Structured tables for trauma-informed data handling  
   - Ready to migrate to PostgreSQL if needed  

4. **Frontend Development**  
   - Built responsive layouts with HTML, CSS.
   - Added interactive elements with JavaScript  
   - Styled with emotional cues (color, spacing, copy)  

5. **Views & Templates**  
   - Created Django views for onboarding, dashboard, and resource pages

##  Prompting Journey (Vibe Coding)

This project was built using emotionally paced prompting. Here‚Äôs how the flow unfolded:

- **Prompt 1**: ‚ÄúDesign a dashboard that feels like a warm hug but still gets things done.‚Äù  
- **Prompt 2**: ‚ÄúHow do we guide someone gently through a story they‚Äôre scared to tell?‚Äù  
- **Prompt 3**: ‚ÄúBuild a layout that breathes‚Äîspace, softness, and clarity.‚Äù  
- **Prompt 4**: ‚ÄúWhat does safety look like in a button? In a font?‚Äù

Each prompt led to design and dev decisions that centered emotional safety. The vibe coding method allowed intuition and empathy to guide the technical build.
